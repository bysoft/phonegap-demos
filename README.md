==============

The haus for demo applications built with PhoneGap

# Reason

To provide example applications of PhoneGap in use, primarily as a learning tool for those devloping mobile applications with the framework.

# Possible Approaches

There are essentially three ways we can do this:

1. Create one application for *each* API/plugin.
2. Create one application that allows for "viewing" of each API in action. Not a "real" application, per say - very demo-y.
3. Create many real (app store worthy) applications that utilize multiple APIs/plugins.

## Initial Approach

Create a real, app-store-worthy application that utilizes most APIs.

### Possible Application Types

1. __game__
  * accelerometer
  * media
  * notification
  * events

2. __photosharing/editing__
  * camera
  * capture
  * contacts
  * geolocation
  * notification

3. __physical activity tracking__
  * geolocation
  * compass
  * capture
  * media
  * contacts

4. __to-do list__ 
This is the one that Joni will tackle first, as it can demonstrate most APIs and is an common/understood app type.
  * storage
  * device
  * events
  * connection
  * notification
  * camera/capture
  * media/capture
  * contacts
  * geolocation
  * accelerometer
  * file
  * *missing*: compass  : (
